    <h3>What</h3>


    <h2>Continuous Integration (CI)</h2>

    <h3>What</h3>
    The practice of integrating source code changes frequently and ensuring that the integrated codebase is in a
    workable state. Each integration is automatically verified by running a set of tests to catch issues early in the
    development process. Key aspects are:
    <ul>
        <li>Developers commit frequently (often daily or more)</li>
        <li>Automated tests run on each commit to ensure the changes don't break existing functionality.</li>
        <li>The code is built and tested automatically after each commit to ensure that the software is in a deployable
            state.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Why</h3>
    It helps maintaining high code quality and improving collaboration among developers. Some key benefits are:

    <ul>
        <li>Early bug detection.</li>
        <li>Faster feedback.</li>
        <li>Reduced merge conflicts. If a conflict occurs, it is relatively small.</li>
        <li>Consistent quality.</li>
        <li>Improved collaboration.</li>
        <li>Reduced risk in releases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How</h3>
    CI implementation involves several steps and tools that automate the process of integrating code frequently. An
    example flow could be:
    <ul>
        <li>A developer commits code to the repository.</li>
        <li>Azure DevOps triggers a CI pipeline defined in Azure Pipelines.</li>
        <li>The pipeline compiles the code and runs automated tests.</li>
        <li>The results (pass or fail) are reported back to the development team.</li>
        <li>If the build passes, the code is merged into the main branch, and artifacts can be stored for deployment.
        </li>
        <li>If it fails, the developer is alerted to fix the issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What</h3>
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a "language" that defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is
    the
    most basic building block of the web.
    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another. HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images,
    and
    other content for display in a Web browser.
    Some of these "elements" are: head, title, body, header, article". An HTML element is set off from other text in
    a
    document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by &lt; and &gt;.
    <h3>Why</h3>
    Before HTML, there was no universal way to share documents or information between computers over the
    internet.
    The internet existed, but it was primarily used for transferring
    files (like text and images) between systems that spoke different, sometimes incompatible languages. If you
    wanted to share information, there wasn’t a standardized way for
    documents to be displayed in a user-friendly way across different machines and systems.
    <h3>How</h3>
    Assume that the browser has gotten the HTML document (most likely via an HTTP request) and decides to render
    it.
    At this point, the browser just has a raw HTML file. The first thing that needs to be done is to parse the file,
    which means creating a structured tree of elements, called the DOM (Document Object Model). A note (from chatgpt):
    The browser builds the DOM incrementally, meaning it processes the HTML as it recieves it, allowing it to start
    rendering the page before the entire HTML document is downloaded. While the DOM is being built, CSS files are
    downloaded
    (or inline styles) and parsed, which gives detailed information about how the elements should look like.
    When the browser encounters a &lt;script&gt;, it pauses the HTML parsing and executes the Javascript code using its
    Javascript
    engine (e.eg. V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox). If the script tag is placed in the head, it can block the
    parsing of
    the reist of the document until it finishes execution. Modern browsers support async and defer to avoid this issue
    (if it is),
    by allowing scripts to be executed asynchronously to avoid blocking the rendering.


    <h3>QA</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            How different is the parsing of HTML from browser to browser?
        </li>
        <li>
            Is the DOM exactly the same in all big browsers?
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Why do we need to have DOCTYPE at the beginning of an HTML file? Do we have to? </h3>
            The DOCTYPE declaration is necessary to ensure that the browser renders your HTML page in Standards Mode
            instead of Quirks Mode.
            It’s mandatory if you want consistent, predictable behavior from modern browsers.
            HTML5 has the simplest and most efficient DOCTYPE (
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;), which is the standard for web development today.
            Older DOCTYPE versions, like those for HTML 4.01 and XHTML, are less common but may still be encountered in
            legacy projects.
