    <h1>1.1 What is urban drainage?</h1>
    Drainage systems are essential in urban areas due to human impact on the natural water cycle, involving water
    abstraction for human use and covering land with impermeable surfaces. This results in two types of water needing
    drainage: wastewater (used water from households and industry) and stormwater (rainwater on built-up areas). If not
    properly drained, wastewater can cause pollution, while stormwater can lead to flooding and pollution from surface
    contaminants.

    Urban drainage systems aim to manage these waters to protect human health and the environment, though often with
    little public awareness. Most urban drainage relies on artificial sewer systems, while isolated communities may rely
    on natural drainage. However, modern approaches favor more sustainable, natural drainage options.

    The complexity of urban drainage extends beyond simply moving water; it involves managing interactions between
    wastewater and stormwater, especially in combined sewers where both mix, creating environmental challenges. Drainage
    solutions must balance technical, environmental, and social considerations, requiring collaboration between
    engineers, policymakers, and citizens to achieve sustainable outcomes.
