    <h1>Chaper 1: Introduction</h1>
    <h2>1.1 What is urban drainage?</h2>
    Drainage systems are essential in urban areas due to human impact on the natural water cycle, involving water
    abstraction for human use and covering land with impermeable surfaces. This results in two types of water needing
    drainage: wastewater (used water from households and industry) and stormwater (rainwater on built-up areas). If not
    properly drained, wastewater can cause pollution, while stormwater can lead to flooding and pollution from surface
    contaminants.

    Urban drainage systems aim to manage these waters to protect human health and the environment, though often with
    little public awareness. Most urban drainage relies on artificial sewer systems, while isolated communities may rely
    on natural drainage. However, modern approaches favor more sustainable, natural drainage options.

    The complexity of urban drainage extends beyond simply moving water; it involves managing interactions between
    wastewater and stormwater, especially in combined sewers where both mix, creating environmental challenges. Drainage
    solutions must balance technical, environmental, and social considerations, requiring collaboration between
    engineers, policymakers, and citizens to achieve sustainable outcomes.

    <h2>1.2 Effects of urbanisation on drainage</h2>
    Human development significantly impacts how rainwater moves through the environment. In nature, rainwater partly
    evaporates, is absorbed by plants, infiltrates into groundwater, or flows as surface runoff. The balance of these
    processes depends on the type of surface and changes over time as the ground becomes saturated.

    Urbanization disrupts this cycle by covering natural surfaces with impermeable materials, which increases surface
    runoff and reduces infiltration. This causes more water to reach rivers more quickly, leading to higher and faster
    peaks in river flow, raising the risk of sudden flooding. Reduced infiltration also means less groundwater recharge,
    which affects water reserves.

    Urban runoff carries pollutants from surfaces and air, and stormwater mixing with wastewater in drainage systems can
    introduce further contaminants into rivers. The increased volume of wastewater in urban areas results from standard
    conveniences, like taps and drains, and the use of water for waste disposal. Wastewater treatment facilities
    mitigate some pollutants before water re-enters the cycle, as nature alone cannot handle the volume created by
    cities.

    Overall, urban drainage systems create higher, sudden peaks in river flow, introduce pollutants, and increase the
    need for artificial water treatment, mimicking yet heavily burdening natural processes.
    <h1>Chaper 20: Flow models</h1>
    <h2>20.1 Models and urban drainage engineering</h2>
    This section describes the role of modeling in urban drainage systems, focusing on hydrological (rainfall and
    wastewater inputs) and hydraulic aspects (flow rate and depth in sewers). Some models also incorporate water quality
    to track pollutants. Models help engineers understand drainage system behavior under various conditions, answering
    "What if..." questions.

    The early drainage models, like the Rational Method, offered simple calculations for rainfall-to-runoff conversion.
    More sophisticated computer models emerged in the 1970s, such as SWMM in the USA and the WASSP package in the UK.
    These innovations transformed drainage engineering from an experience-based field to one using advanced analysis
    tools.

    Modern software like HydroWorks, InfoWorks, and MIKE URBAN allow both design (creating new systems) and simulation
    (analyzing existing systems under specific conditions). Design models focus on capacity under extreme flows, while
    simulation models analyze details like flow rate, depth, and flood risk, highlighting areas needing improvement.

    These tools integrate with GIS for better visualization, making complex sewer modeling more accurate and accessible
    for engineers in both design and simulation contexts.
    <h1>Chaper 8: Hydraulics</h1>
    <h2>8.2 Basic principles</h2>
    <h3>8.2.1 Pressure</h3>
    Pressure force per unit area. The common units for pressure
    are kN/m&sup2; or bars (1 bar 100 kN/m&sup2; ).
    Absolute pressure is pressure relative to a vacuum, and gauge pressure
    is pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. Gauge pressure is used in most
    hydraulic calculations. Atmospheric pressure varies but is approximately
    1 bar.
